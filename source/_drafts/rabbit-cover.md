*You wake up. You must have been gone for at least an hour or so. This really wasn't the plan. [Damn. Gotta cram in the work at night now.] What the hell happened?*
You didn't fall asleep- rather, you got pulled into another *internet rabbit hole*. Even though you set out to do some much needed work, you spent your time mindlessly browsing some corner of the internet. Your fault? Partially. Our ancient biological bodies surely weren't designed to withstand such an overload of impulses - rather: we are wired to be attracted to them. What **is** within our control, though, is whether we manage to 'catch' ourselves before we dive deep into the rabbit hole of distraction; and whether we make the conscious decision to limit the luring distractions in the first place. Let's explore how we can harness ourselves against distractions in the modern world.










Don't fall into the internet's rabbit hole. Or, at least, only do so **intentionally**. This blogpost explains you how to avoid 'losing yourself' on the internet, procrastinating and avoiding your actual task, using a Chrome web extension for assistance.
