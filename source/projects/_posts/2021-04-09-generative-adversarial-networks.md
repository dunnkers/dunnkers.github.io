Generative Adversarial Networks are a relatively new type of technique for generating samples from a learned distribution, in which two networks are simultaneously trained whilst competing against each other. Applications for GAN’s are numerous, including image up-sampling, image generation, and the recently quite popular ’deep fakes’.
In this project, we aim to train such a Generative Adversarial Network ourselves, with the purpose of image generation, specifically. As the generation of human faces has been widely studied, we have chosen a different topic, namely: the generation of paintings. While large datasets of paintings are available, we have opted to restrict ourselves to one artist, as we believe this will give a better chance at producing realistic paintings. For this, we have chosen the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, who is known for his unique style.
