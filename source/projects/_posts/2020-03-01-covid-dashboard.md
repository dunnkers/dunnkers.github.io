We are in the midst of a global pandemic. At the time this project started, the Corona virus was still just a headline for most - but in the meantime it reached and impacted all of our lives. Fighting such a pandemic happens in many ways on multiple scales. We are interested in how this can be done on the societal level: using data. We built a pipeline capable of processing a large dataset and created a visualization of the areas most vulnerable to Corona which includes reported cases in real-time.
