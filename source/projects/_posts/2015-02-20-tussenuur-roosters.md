At my school, students often had gaps in their schedules. In between lessons scheduled for the day, one would often have breaks in between. But because you chose a personalized package of classes to follow, everyone's schedule was also different. So, it would be hard to know with whom you could spend those breaks! To solve this, I developed this app. It allows students to find with whom they have breaks so they can hang out with them whilst waiting for the next class ðŸ˜Š. The app was used in the school by many students and the project was graded 9.0/10 by my Computer Science teacher.
